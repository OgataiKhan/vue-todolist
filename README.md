# Vue To Do List

This project is a to do list created using Bootstrap and Vue.js.  
Each task is represented by a Javascript object containing the task itself and a boolean indicating whether or not the task has been completed.

Features include:

- Tasks being barred if they have been completed.  
- An "X" button for each task that eliminates it from the list.  
- An input bar to add new tasks to the list, either by clicking on the button or by pressing "Enter".  
- The ability to toggle tasks between the completed and the incomplete state by clicking on their text.
